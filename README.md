AKWF or Adventure Kid Waveforms is a collection of one cycle waveforms to be used within synthesizers or other kinds of sound generators. It is basically the smallest sound possible to sample and still get the overall feel of the sampled instrument.

## Note

I converted the MonoMachine folder to SCW's with 367 samples using https://github.com/David303ttl/dt_scw_chain. From these folders I made Digitakt friendly chains. 
Some of the directories did not have 64 SCW's. They are in a separate folder - it's a toss up.
